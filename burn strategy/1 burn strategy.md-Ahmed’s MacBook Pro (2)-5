National Burn Care Strategy

1. Purpose, Scope, and Definitions
Purpose: Establish a national, resilient, and equitable burn care system that reduces burn incidence, mortality, disability, and socioeconomic impact.
Scope: Prevention, pre-hospital care, acute care, rehabilitation, reintegration, research, and preparedness for mass burn events.
Definitions: Burn care levels of service (Level 1, 2, 3), mass burn incident, essential burn care package, and referral criteria.

2. Situational Analysis (Evidence Base)
- Burden: Current incidence, prevalence, case-fatality, disability-adjusted life years, and hotspot mapping by governorate.
- Case mix: Adult/child distribution, etiology (scalds, flame, electrical, chemical), severity (TBSA), inhalation injury.
- Capacity: Existing burn beds, ICU beds, operating theaters, workforce, rehab services, and geographical access.
- System performance: Time to definitive care, referral delays, infection rates, mortality by TBSA, and length of stay.
- Financial protection: Out-of-pocket expenditure, catastrophic health spending, insurance coverage.
- Gaps: Limited specialized workforce, delayed referral, inadequate rehab and mental health, weak prevention, inconsistent protocols, fragmented data.
- Opportunities: Partnerships with universities, NGOs, regional burn societies, and telehealth.

3. Vision and Mission
Vision: A resilient and equitable national burn care system that ensures timely, high-quality, and accessible prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and reintegration for all burn patients.
Mission: Reduce burn-related morbidity and mortality through integrated prevention, acute care, rehabilitation, research, and community support, guided by international best practices.

4. Core Values and Principles
- Equity and Access: Burn care available to all regardless of socioeconomic status or location.
- Quality and Safety: Evidence-based, patient-centered, and multidisciplinary care.
- Efficiency and Sustainability: Optimal use of resources and cost-effective care.
- Resilience: Preparedness for mass-casualty burn incidents.
- Innovation: Adoption of new technologies and research.
- Rehabilitation and Reintegration: Survivor-centered recovery and social inclusion.

5. Strategic Goal
Reduce burn incidence and improve survival, recovery, and long-term outcomes through comprehensive prevention, high-quality specialized care, rehabilitation, and a resilient, evidence-based burn care system.

6. Strategic Objectives (Outcomes)
1) Reduce burn incidence by X% by year Y through risk reduction and prevention.
2) Reduce burn case-fatality rate by X% through timely access and standardized care.
3) Improve functional and psychosocial outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-injury.
4) Achieve national coverage of essential burn care services across all governorates.
5) Ensure national readiness for mass burn incidents within 3 years.

7. Audit Findings and Critical Gaps (Expert Review)
- No defined essential burn care package or minimum service standards by level of care.
- Absence of national burn registry and agreed minimum data set for surveillance.
- Weak triage/referral criteria and inconsistent integration with EMS and trauma systems.
- Limited emphasis on infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and quality improvement.
- Insufficient detail on financing, sustainability, and social protection for burn survivors.
- Governance roles are defined, but accountability mechanisms, decision rights, and escalation pathways are unclear.
- Preparedness described generally; surge capacity, mutual aid, and burn disaster logistics need specification.
- Rehab and mental health are mentioned but not operationalized (workforce, funding, continuity).

8. Pillars and Key Strategic Actions

Pillar 1: Prevention and Community Awareness
- National prevention strategy targeting homes, schools, workplaces, and high-risk industries.
- Burn prevention and first aid in school curricula and community training.
- Enforce safety regulations for housing, industry, transport, and hazardous materials.
- Risk mapping and targeted campaigns for high-incidence districts.
- Engage community leaders, civil society, and media to sustain behavior change.

Pillar 2: Service Delivery and Clinical Care
- Define three levels of burn care, services, staffing, and referral criteria per level.
- Establish or upgrade burn units at central and sub-central hospitals with agreed standards.
- Standardized referral and counter-referral pathways with EMS integration.
- Implement national clinical guidelines for burn resuscitation, wound care, surgery, ICU care, and pain control.
- Infection prevention and control standards, antimicrobial stewardship, and sepsis protocols.
- 24/7 access to essential diagnostics, blood products, and operating capacity.

Pillar 3: Workforce and Training
- National burn workforce plan with staffing norms by level of care and case load.
- Standardized curricula for surgeons, nurses, rehab, psychologists, and social workers.
- Continuous professional development, certification, and retention incentives.
- Tele-mentoring and e-learning for peripheral facilities.
- Establish and train burn assessment teams and burn specialist teams for surge events.

Pillar 4: Infrastructure, Medicines, and Technology
- Upgrade burn wards, ICUs, and operating theaters to defined standards.
- Ensure continuous availability of essential medicines, dressings, grafting materials, and PPE.
- Establish or expand skin/tissue banking capability with regulatory oversight.
- Maintain equipment lifecycle management, calibration, and safety checks.
- Telemedicine for consultations, referrals, and follow-up.

Pillar 5: Rehabilitation and Reintegration
- Early, in-hospital rehab and long-term outpatient services integrated into care pathways.
- Psychosocial support, peer networks, and family counseling.
- Reconstructive surgery access for functional and cosmetic outcomes.
- Vocational rehabilitation and return-to-work programs.
- Community-based rehabilitation and follow-up.

Pillar 6: Governance, Policy, and Research
- National multi-sectoral burn care committee with clear TOR, authority, and reporting.
- National policies, SOPs, and legal frameworks for safety and occupational protection.
- Establish burn registry and surveillance with a minimum data set.
- Operational research on outcomes, costs, and service delivery models.
- Annual national review and public reporting of performance indicators.

9. Service Delivery Model (Minimum Standards)
- Level 1: Initial stabilization, first aid, and referral capability.
- Level 2: Definitive care for moderate burns, surgery, and short-term rehab.
- Level 3: Comprehensive care for severe burns, advanced ICU, complex reconstruction.
- Referral criteria: TBSA thresholds, inhalation injury, electrical/chemical burns, pediatric burns.
- Minimum staffing and bed ratios per level, including ICU and theater capacity.

10. Preparedness and Resilience
- National mass burn incident plan with surge bed mapping and mutual aid agreements.
- Pre-positioned stockpiles of dressings, fluids, and critical supplies.
- Regular simulation exercises and after-action reviews.
- Integrate burn surge protocols within national disaster response and trauma systems.

11. Financing and Sustainability
- Costed implementation plan with phased investments and domestic financing.
- Health insurance coverage and social protection for burn patients and survivors.
- Donor alignment and pooled procurement to reduce costs.

12. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL)
- Core indicators: incidence, case-fatality, time to definitive care, infection rate, length of stay, rehab completion, and functional outcomes.
- Data systems: national burn registry, facility reporting, and periodic audits.
- Quality improvement: morbidity and mortality reviews, clinical audits, and guideline adherence.

13. Implementation Framework
- Short-term (1-2 years): guidelines, registry, training, and pilot sites.
- Medium-term (3-5 years): scale-up services, rehab, and prevention programs.
- Long-term (5-10 years): full national coverage, mature data systems, and sustained quality improvement.

14. Risk Management
- Risks: workforce attrition, supply chain disruptions, funding gaps, disaster surge beyond capacity.
- Mitigation: retention incentives, buffer stocks, multi-year financing, mutual aid agreements.

15. Looking Forward
Burn care is a complex continuum that spans prevention to social reintegration. This strategy sets a 10-year course with measurable outcomes, a costed operational plan, and a national commitment to quality, equity, and resilience aligned with SDGs.
