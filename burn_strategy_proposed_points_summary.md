Proposed New Points Summary

1) Purpose, Scope, Definitions
- Purpose: reduce incidence, mortality, disability, and socioeconomic impact.
- Scope: prevention, pre-hospital, acute care, rehab, reintegration, research, mass-casualty preparedness.
- Definitions: Level 1/2/3 care, essential burn care package, referral criteria, mass burn incident.

2) Situational Analysis (expanded evidence base)
- Burden: incidence, prevalence, DALYs, hotspot mapping by governorate.
- Case mix: age split, etiology, TBSA, inhalation injury.
- Capacity: burn/ICU beds, OR capacity, rehab services, workforce by level.
- Performance: time to definitive care, referral delays, infection rates, LOS, mortality by TBSA.
- Financial protection: OOP spending, catastrophic expenditure, insurance coverage.
- Gaps: workforce shortages, inconsistent protocols, weak data systems, limited rehab/mental health.
- Opportunities: universities, NGOs, regional societies, telehealth.

3) Strategic Objectives (measurable outcomes)
- Reduce incidence by X% by year Y.
- Reduce case-fatality by X% via timely access and standardized care.
- Improve functional/psychosocial outcomes at 6 and 12 months.
- Achieve national coverage of essential burn care services.
- Ensure national readiness for mass burn incidents within 3 years.

4) Service Delivery and Clinical Care (added standards)
- Define Level 1/2/3 services, staffing ratios, ICU/OR capacity, essential equipment.
- National referral criteria: TBSA thresholds, inhalation injury, electrical/chemical, pediatric burns.
- Infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and sepsis protocols.
- 24/7 access to blood, fluids, labs, and operating capability for severe burns.

5) Workforce (surge capacity)
- Workforce planning includes BATs and BSTs for mass casualty events with aligned training and deployment plans.

6) Infrastructure and Supply Chain
- National supply chain standards for dressings, grafting materials, antimicrobials, and surge buffer stocks.

7) Governance (accountability and registry)
- National burn registry with a minimum dataset and mandatory reporting.
- Clear accountability: decision rights, escalation pathways, annual public reporting.

8) Service Delivery Model and Minimum Standards (new section)
- Level 1: first aid, stabilization, referral.
- Level 2: definitive care for moderate burns, surgery, short-term rehab.
- Level 3: comprehensive care for severe burns, advanced ICU, complex reconstruction.
- Referral criteria triggers and minimum staffing/bed ratios per level.

9) MEL (expanded)
- Added indicators: infection rates, sepsis rates, graft take rate, LOS, rehab completion, return-to-work.
- Quality improvement: morbidity/mortality reviews, clinical audits, guideline adherence.

10) Risk Management and Resilience
- Surge bed mapping, mutual aid agreements, national logistics plan for rapid distribution of supplies.

11) Financing and Sustainability (new section)
- Costed implementation plan with phased investments and domestic financing.
- Insurance coverage and social protection for burn patients and survivors.
- Pooled procurement to reduce costs and improve availability.
